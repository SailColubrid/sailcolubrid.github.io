I’m a first-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Enigneering, Carnegie Mellon University. I am co-advised by Prof. [Anupam Datta](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/danupam/) and Prof. [Matt Fredrikson](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/) in the [**Accountable System Lab**](https://fairlyaccountable.org). My current concentration is the development of interpretations for deep neural networks. Before joining CMU, I received my B.S. in Electronic Science and Technology from Beijing Institute of Technology.
